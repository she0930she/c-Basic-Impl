Test your Knowledge
1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C# ?
    stringBuilder[i]: mutable
    string: immutable, notnot use string[i]
    
2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
    System.Array
    
3. How do you sort an array in C#?
    Array.Sort(numbers);

4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in
an array?
    arr.Length
    
5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
    yes, use object.
    object[] arrObj = new object[] { 1, true, 5.00, "ghdj" };

6. What’s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
    both used on creating copies of array.
    System.Array.CopyTo(): returns nothing(void), it copies one array to another
    System.Array.Clone(): return a new array object


Practice Arrays
1. Copying an Array
Write code to create a copy of an array. First, start by creating an initial array. (You can use
whatever type of data you want.) Let’s start with 10 items. Declare an array variable and
assign it a new array with 10 items in it. Use the things we’ve discussed to put some values
in the array.
Now create a second array variable. Give it a new array with the same length as the first.
Instead of using a number for this length, use the Lengthproperty to get the size of the
original array.
Use a loop to read values from the original array and place them in the new array. Also
print out the contents of both arrays, to be sure everything copied correctly.
